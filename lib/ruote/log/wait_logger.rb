module Ruote

  #
  # The logic behind Ruote::Dashboard#wait_for is implemented here.
  #
  # This logger keeps track of the last 147 events. This number can
  # be tweaked via the 'wait_logger_max' storage option
  # (http://ruote.rubyforge.org/configuration.html)
  #
  # One doesn't play directly with this class. It's available only via
  # the Ruote::Dashboard#wait_for and Ruote::Dashboard#noisy=
  #
  # To access the log of processed msgs, look at history services, not
  # at this wait_logger.
